# Computer-Networks

## Project Description
Part 1 of the project uses UDP to create a connection from a server program to a client program. The client program sends the IP, Port, and Message to the sever program through the command line.
The server receives the message and echos it back to the client. Both programs display the message on screen.

Part 2 of the project uses TCP to create a connection from a server program to a client program. The client program sends the IP, Port, and Message to the sever program through the command line.
The server receives the message and echos it back to the client. Both programs display the message on screen.

## Install
Both programs were compliled on a Linux OS using gcc such as: gcc tcp_echo_server.c -o
